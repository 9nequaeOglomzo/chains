## Step 3: Apply Twixtor Pro 6 to Your Footage
 
To apply Twixtor Pro 6 to your footage, you need to import your video clip into After Effects and create a new composition. Then, drag and drop the Twixtor effect from the Effects & Presets panel onto your footage layer. You can find the Twixtor effect under RE:Vision Plug-ins > Twixtor.
 
Once you apply the effect, you will see a number of parameters in the Effect Controls panel. You can adjust these parameters to customize the effect according to your needs. Here are some of the most important parameters:
 
- **Input Frame Rate:** This is the frame rate of your original footage. You should set this to match your footage's frame rate exactly.
- **Output Frame Rate:** This is the frame rate of your output composition. You can set this to any value you want, depending on how slow or fast you want your footage to be.
- **Speed:** This is the percentage of speed that you want to apply to your footage. A value of 100% means no change in speed, a value of 50% means half speed, and a value of 200% means double speed.
- **Main BG Layer:** This is the layer that contains your background footage. You can use this option if you want to composite your foreground footage over a different background.
- **Motion Sensitivity:** This is the amount of motion estimation that Twixtor will perform on your footage. A higher value means more accurate tracking, but also more processing time.
- **Motion Vector Type:** This is the type of motion vector that Twixtor will use to track the movement of objects and pixels. You can choose between Forward, Backward, Both, or None.
- **Motion Vector Color Map:** This is a visual representation of the motion vectors that Twixtor generates. You can use this option to debug or fine-tune your effect.
